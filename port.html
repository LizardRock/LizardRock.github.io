Here you can read off the list of software that I have created. <br/>
While I have made many programs, I fell these are the ones worth "Showcasing"<br/>
You will notice that all but BotM are not available for download. <br/>
This is because I have not written up a ToS or EULA for these programs, and to avoid any legal complications to myself, have decided to keep them private otherwise.<br/>
not to say that they can be provided upon special situations, such as employers.<br/>
Images and Videos to be added soon.

<b>The FileSorter</b><br/>
The FileSorter is a utility program developed to make my life a little easier. As the name implies, it sorts file. More spesifically, it takes any and all files inside a folder marked "Files To Be Sorted" and sorts them, by extension, to a series of folders inside another folder marked "Sorted Files". this allows me to take a mess of files, and easily sort them into pictures, videos, documents, and so on. The FileSorter runs silently and without complication.<br/>
I have taken it a step further personally and made the "Files To Be Sorted" folder as my default downloads folder, as well as having marked the FileSorter program to run on startup. This allows me to mantain an organized digital workspace over time. I still use it today.<br/>
Originally written in GML, I have since rewritten it from the ground up in Java, and now operates as a standalone runnable .JAR file.

<b>CCT SoundBoard</b><br/>
The CCT SoundBoard is just that, a SoundBoard developed for the Central Crossing Theatre. During my time there I discovered that their methods of playing audio sound effects were less than desirable, so I developed this to make the process as easy as possible. It displays a virtual keyboard, when you press the corrisponding key, or click on the key on screen, it would play a sound effect. right clicking on it will bring up an options drop down list. allowing the user to load a new sound, clear a sound, set it to be a togglable loop, label the key, and even change the color on screen for easy oganization. You can even save all sounds and settings as a ZIP file, so one could work on it from home, save it, and load it up on site. This made playing sound effects during live performances a much easier task.<br/>
Personally I have found that the number row is good for creating ambient loop keys.<br/>
Written in GML, operates as a standalone runnable .EXE file.

<b>GM48 - Castle Collector</b><br/>
Under normal circumstances, this would be a horrible splur oh bad graphics, design, and physics, but these are not normal circumstances. the GM48 was a small scale 48 hour game making jam. working alone, I had to code, draw, and design all aspect of this game within the 48 hours. The Theme was Castles. Castle Collector is a side scrolling platormer, where you play as a magic wielding rouge, who breaks into a castle, slays the king, and claims the thrown as his own.<br/>
while I did not win, I recieved special mention for a creative and original weapon concept. as well as recieving the side award for "Most Advanced enemy AI"<br/>
It is by no means a good game, but it shows that when it counts, I can write strong and efficient code when under pressure.<br/>
Written in GML, operates as a standalone runnable .EXE file.

<p>
<b>Pokemon Catching Simulator</b><br/>
After a frustrating bout with a Moltres, I decided to look into the algorithms used for catching pokemon. With some effort and research, I developed the Pokemon Catching Simulator. A simple (and visually appealing if I say so myself) Program that, when given the needed information, while not only tell you the percentage likelihood of successful capture, but actually simulate said attempt with an on screen pokeball.<br/>
Its a great tool for estimating how many UltraBalls the player will need. Though the odds can seem pretty disheartening.<br/>
Written in GML, operates as a standalone runnable .EXE file. <br/>
Intended to be rewritten and designed in Java to work as an android app at a point in the future.

<p>
<b>DarkNES</b><br/>
DarkNES is a top down RPG game with an art style nearly identical to the traditional Nintendo Entertainment System. it is an ambient medieval world where a curse plauges the land. Strongly inspired by Dark Souls, This game yields a high pushiment for mistakes, and a high sense of victory when your challenges are overcome. <br/>
Still very early in development, a lot of engine refinement is needed.<br/>
Written in GML.
</p>

<p>
<b>BotM</b><br/>
by far my biggest and most tended to project. BotM is a Twitch Bot. capable of most to all of the tasks popular bots can do. as well as having a few unique features that seperate it from the crowd. originally it was developed soley for the streamer CarlyontheMoon, and named <b>B</b>ot_<b>o</b>n<b>t</b>he<b>M</b>oon accordingly, but as interest in the bot grew, I refined it to work for any and all users. and renamed the software BotM. now it is used daily by several streamers. This is the only program publicly available. and details can be found on the Tab marked "BotM"<br/>
It is still in development even now. and updates of many sizes happen irregularly,<br/>
Written in Java. as a standalone runnable JAR file.
