  <p>
Whoa whoa whoa? did you donate to me? holy butts thank you! </br>
Listen, I know that some text on a webpage doesnt really hold much sincerity, but really, thank you. </br>
little things like this really help me get through the day.
I may not know what i did to merit this kindness, but im glad i was able to help you however i did.</br>
Karma smiles on you friend.</br>
