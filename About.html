<p>
I do alot with myself.<br/>
Mainly my hobbies consist of Software Development, and Music Production.<br/>
More information regarding any software I make public can be found on this site.<br/>
I love programming because it allows me to create a complex and efficient creation, <br/>
allowing me to flex my intellectual muscle.<br/>
My dream is to make a living in Game Development however.<br/>
I am just a hobby musician, making music how I feel.<br/>
It can be found here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lizardrock">https://soundcloud.com/lizardrock</a> <br/>
Its all free to download too.<br/>
I love music because it allows me to express my creative self in an abstract way.

</p>

<p>
Whats with the symbol you ask? <br/>
Thats the "LizardRock Symbol" <br/>
A design I came up with ages ago, I use it to represent me and all creative works I create<br/>
(I even have a Tattoo of it)
</p>

<p>
Though I find this part a tad difficult to write.<br/>
who exactly IS LizardRock?</p>
<p>
Ask my family and theyd say I'm quiet, unorganized, but intellegent and hardworking.<br/>
Ask my friends and they'd say I'm fun, eccentric, and helpful.<br/>
Ask my employers and they'd say I'm Hardworking, cooperative, and an asset to their team.<br/>
Ask Twitch and they'd say I'm Intellegent, creative, funny, and a Lizard (SmartAsses)<br/>
</p>
<p>
Basically I am what others see me as.<br/>
I try to help anyone who needs me,<br/>
and I am always striving to improve myself.<br/>
anything more than that stretches farther into the superfluities of philosophy than I care to deal with.
